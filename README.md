# freezer_inventory
This project contains the spreadsheet, R code and shiny app for an inventory of freezer samples at the NOAA SWFSC for the Groundfish Analysis Team as of September 5th, 2018. In particular, these samples are predominately composed of samples collected aboard the annual Rockfish Recruitment and Ecosystem Assessment survey as part of a project to collect organisms for stable isotopes. However, there are some samples contained within this spreadsheet that may have been collected for different purposes. The boxes are arranged by year (large red boxes in walk-in freezer), and each samples is contained within a bag that has a unique inventory number "inv_#" which will be displayed when you click on a specific dot within the shiny app. Note: that as of sep 5th, the Hollings Scholar is still working on inventorying the remaining, random, samples of the freezer which will be stored in different red box labeled separately.
